			<div id="description">

			<p>Uh Oh! You failed the sleep adventure because you chose to drive home.  You thought that because you had some sleep, you were awake enough to get home safely.  You had some near accidents on the road due to microsleeps at the wheel, giving you quite a scare.  Now, you're even more stressed.</p>
			<p>The next day, you arrive late to work and turn in a poorly-written proposal.  You get a bad performance review at work from your manager.</p>
			<p>Because you were sleep-deprived for most of days, you're not feeling that well. You go to the doctor for a check-up, where you discover that your immune system has been weakened.  You're at higher risk for cancer, diabetes, and gaining weight due to an increase in the hormone ghrelin and a decrease in leptin.</p>

			<p>Next time, you'll manage your work a bit better and get a good night of rest.  You will also never drive when you are sleep-deprived, as nearly.  Impaired driving ability after just 22 hours without sleep is equivalent to illegal DUI, and alcohol dramatically amplifies the effects of sleep loss (Walker Lecture 13).</p>
