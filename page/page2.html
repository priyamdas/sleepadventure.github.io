			<div id="description">

			<p>You get into the office at the usual time and settle into your work.</p>
			<p>During your lunch break, you come across an article online about the importance of sleeping well. It mentions things like having a strengthened immune system, better memory recall, and even greater creativity at work if you sleep about 8-9 hours a night. However, if you skimp on sleep for even one night, that's sleep that can never be "made up" another night.</p>

			<p>You also note with some interest that people who regularly get enough sleep are perceived as more attractive than those who don't, giving new meaning to "beauty sleep."</p>
