			<p>Uh Oh! You failed the sleep adventure because you pulled an all-nighter.</p>
			<p>The next day, you arrive 2 hours late to work and turn in a poorly-written proposal.  You get a bad performance review at work from your manager.</p>
			<p>Because you suffered from total sleep deprivation, you're not feeling that well. You go to the doctor for a check-up, where you discover that your immune system has been weakened.  You're at higher risk for cancer, diabetes, and gaining weight due to an increase in the hormone ghrelin and a decrease in leptin.</p>
			<p>You should also stop drinking so much coffee, it only blocks the hormone adenosine which tricks your body into thinking you don't need sleep. Next time, you'll manage your work a bit better and get a good night of rest.</p>
