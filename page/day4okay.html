			<p>You have an uneventful night of sleep, though you oversleep slightly and barely make it to the department meeting on time. When it's time for your presentation, you deliver it perfectly, since you practiced so much last night. However, some questions at the end catch you off guard. You vaguely remember a document pertaining to said question. As you desperately try to recall a relevant detail, your boss smoothly steps in and tells the asker that you'll look into it and send along the relevant information by the end of today.</p>

			<p>After the meeting, your boss takes you aside and tells you that while you performed exceedingly well under pressure, she's worried that maybe she gave you too much at once and that you aren't quite ready to take on this kind of work yet. </p>

			<p>However, she's willing to work closely with you over the next few months to refine and implement your project. You feel immense gratitude towards your boss for being so invested in your growth and resolve to become an employee she'll be proud of -- starting with fixing your sleep habits!</p>
