			<div id="title">Result: You Passed!</div>
			<div id="description">

			<p>Congratulations! You passed the sleep adventure because you chose not to drive home, even though you continued to be in situations where you were sleep-deprived. You got home safely thanks to your well-rested coworker.</p>
			<p>The next day, you go to work and finish your proposal. You receive a stellar performance report for your great work and safe habits.</p>
			<p>However, because you were sleep-deprived for most of days, you're not feeling that well. You go to the doctor for a check-up, where you discover that your immune system has been weakened.</p>

			<p>You might have passed the test, but maybe next time, you'll manage your work a bit better and get a good night of rest. PVT studies have shown that partial, chronic sleep deprivation is as potent and disruptive as total (acute) deprivation -- and is not overcome by several nights of recovery sleep (Walker Lecture 13).</p>
