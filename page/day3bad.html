				<div id="title">Day 3:</div>
				<div id="description"> <p>"I'm sorry, that wasn't the answer I was looking for" says the voice and it floats away despite your pleas. You can no longer see your hands in front of your face and you start feeling the weight of the oppressive darkness such that you wake up with a scream stuck in your throat. It takes you several minutes to calm down but when you finally drift back to sleep, you are spared from further nightmares and have an otherwise pleasant rest...</p>  
				<p>...Until you wake up again and realize you're 4 hours late to work. Since you were planning on leaving work early today for your annual health check-up, you figure there's no point actually showing up to the office so you email your proposal to your boss and explain that you intend to work from home today.</p>
				<p>You start on your backlog of regular work until it's time for your appointment.</p>
