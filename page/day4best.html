			<div id="title">Result: Nice!</div>
			<div id="description">

			<p>You have an uneventful night of sleep and wake up feeling refreshed. You get to work slightly early in order to place handouts at every seat in the meeting room. When it's time to give your presentation, you deliver it confidently. At the end of it, you're asked some tricky questions but you manage to think on your feet and give satisfactory answers.</p>

			<p>After the meeting, your boss takes you aside. She's practically beaming. She informs you that a Dr. Matthew Walker was in attendance today. He's a sleep expert that the company hired to do some consulting work on employee well-being. He was impressed by your presentation and wants you on his project team. You can't believe your luck!</p>

			<p>However, you know this project will be bigger than anything you've worked on before and you'll need to stay on top of everything -- haphazardly pulling late nights won't cut it. If you can manage your work effectively so that it doesn't interfere with your sleep and health, and produce work of consistent quality, then it's not unreasonable to expect a promotion by the end of the year.</p>

			<p>For now, though, it's time to enjoy a well-earned weekend.</p>
