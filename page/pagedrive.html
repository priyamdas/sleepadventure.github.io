				<div id="title">You drive:</div>
				<div id="description"> <p>"Watch out!!" your coworker yells, and you snap back to attention, swerving back into your lane and narrowly missing the oncoming traffic. You have no idea when you started dozing off at the wheel, but you're considerably shaken and drive the rest of the way fully alert. The meeting goes well -- your co-worker handled it splendidly -- and you both agree that he should be the one to drive back. When you get back to the office and report to your boss, he leaves out the detail of this morning's mishap and for that you are grateful.</p>  
				<p>You have a fairly productive day and manage to finish the proposal, along with the slides for your presentation at the meeting on Friday. Your boss has already gone home, so you'll have her check it over tomorrow.
				</p> </div>


				<div class="fact">** Fun Fact: Driving drowsy is EXTREMELY dangerous. Doing so puts you at risk of having 'microsleeps' at the wheel. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, it only takes 2 seconds to swerve out of land and 4 seconds to get off the road when you drive drowsy.</div>
