				<div id="title">That night...</div>
				<div id="description"> <p>You have no trouble falling asleep, but once again a darkness starts to envelop you in your dreams. This time it completely surrounds you, a pitch black, and you feel a growing sense of terror.</p>  

				<p>Just then, a glowing ball of light floats in front of you and hovers two feet from your face. You hear a voice inside your head --
				</p>
				<p>"If you can answer my question correctly, I'll drive this nightmare away."</p>

				<div class="fact">** Fun Fact: A study done in 1924 by Jenkins & Dalenbach found that after many hours of wakefulness there is catastrophic forgetting of things that you've recently learned. Just 2 hours of sleep is enough to stagnate this forgetfulness. However even partial sleep deprivation over a period of time can be just as bad as total sleep deprivation (Van Dongen et al. 2003).</div>
